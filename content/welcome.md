Hello and welcome! 🎉 I'm thrilled to have you here. This website is serving as a knowledge base where I’ll be sharing my projects, thoughts and other topics that interest me along my learning journey.

## About this website

This website came to fruition largely because I wanted to document things I learn about programming languages, software architecture and distributed systems in general. Additionally, I want a place to come back to if I ever encounter an issue that was hard to fix or manage.

This site was built purely using **Zola**, a **S**tatic **S**ite **G**enerator (**SSG**). That means I only need to write my markdown, push it to GitHub and utilize a GitHub Action that I built to build and serve the website. The site is entirely hosted using **GitHub Pages**.

## What to expect

I can't promise how frequently I will post. That will be up to my dedication, but I will post any time I finish an interesting project or find a solution to some problem that required a lot of research.

Here’s what you can look forward to:

- Software Engineering 🛠️: Notes on software architecture, programming challenges, lessons on distributed systems, databases etc.

- Projects 🧑‍💻: I have ideas about upcoming projects and refactoring older ones.

- Miscellaneous 🥋: Occasionally, I might post about areas of interest other than programming such as weightlifting, combat sports, books and video games.

## Closing thoughts

Thanks for stopping by, feel free to explore the site, and I hope you find something of interest! 🚀

I’d love to hear from you! Reach out if you have any thoughts or questions.
